<h2>A Month in Questions</h2>
<p><i>March 30, 2025</i></p>
<p>I've been using Remnote consistently for the past couple of months and I like it a lot. One of my favourite features is the "daily note." Everyday, I get a new section dedicated to the day and it will normally be populated with new words that I'd learned, links and resources that I'd come across and a to-do list. I will also put questions that come up as I went through my day and perhaps a summary of the main events. I think a good number of these bullet points could be expanded into a full blog post; instead, however, I'm going to feed the notes from the past month into ChatGPT and get a list of questions inspired by them. I hope this can be an artifact of my curiosities.</p>
<p>Note: I didn't edit these questions.</p>
<h2>AI, Models, and Representations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>What does it mean to "version" not just code, but the thought process that went into it?</li>
  <li>Could Datalog help us understand how LLMs encode and organize knowledge?</li>
  <li>How can we represent spatial and temporal knowledge in model embeddings more transparently?</li>
  <li>What is the role of diagrammatic reasoning in mechanistic interpretability?</li>
  <li>What would a declarative interface for inspecting model representations look like?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Research Practice and Knowledge Production</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Why are survey papers so undervalued despite their high utility?</li>
  <li>What would a better "testbed" look like for theoretical ideas?</li>
  <li>How do you measure the value of research beyond citations—perhaps by its inspirational power?</li>
  <li>Could research change more if dissemination models changed? (e.g., new patronage, collaborative distillation)</li>
  <li>What models of citation make sense in the era of training data aggregators and generative AI?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Systems, Semantics, and Programming</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How do gradual static types balance expressiveness and safety?</li>
  <li>What could a type system for CRDT-based declarative visual languages enable?</li>
  <li>What would an IDE for building "agentic datasets" look like?</li>
  <li>How can we define the “schema” of a model’s outputs for debugging and downstream tasks?</li>
  <li>Can a visual diff system make GitHub more understandable for non-programmers?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Institutions, Infrastructure, and Openness</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Why wasn't Dwarkesh's book written using the tooling he often advocates for?</li>
  <li>What institutional infrastructure supports sustained, high-quality distillation (like Distill.pub)?</li>
  <li>Could LLM companies fund data libraries and citation repositories like Wikipedia?</li>
  <li>What would it look like if open-source thinking extended beyond code—into research workflows, testbeds, and policy ideas?</li>
  <li>Could libraries be reimagined as interfaces for analogical thinking and cross-domain discovery?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Economics and Social Thought</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Are markets efficient if they aren’t time-aware? What’s the temporal resolution of an efficient market?</li>
  <li>Is taste a kind of arbitrage?</li>
  <li>What are the limits of the behavioral economics approach to systemic problems?</li>
  <li>Why do people donate to research non-profits? What motivates sustained funding without a clear ROI?</li>
  <li>How do information economics principles apply to generative environments?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Workflow, Expression, and Pedagogy</h2>
<ul>
  <li>What does a “working-in-public” research workflow look like in practice?</li>
  <li>How do you write for translators—people who span fields and need to “carry” your work?</li>
  <li>What does teaching look like when it’s reframed as an act of explaining <em>why</em> something matters?</li>
  <li>How do we track and version procedural knowledge over time?</li>
  <li>Could tests be treated like APIs: contracts that define the interface of your reasoning?</li>
</ul>
