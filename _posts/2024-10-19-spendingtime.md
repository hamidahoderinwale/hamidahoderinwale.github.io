How we spend our days is how we'll spend our lives. Or so they say.

Today was a good day.

But what we do over the weeks, months, and years makes our legacies.

To the extent that I care about legacy, I'll try to do the goodness, the kindness, and the care.

For the privileged, for myself, it seems like our lives are built such that we might not be tasked with finding meaning but with choosing what to care about.

I worry that this thought, the act of it, overwhelms…

So much that a freak event takes your life away, and all this thought is for nothing, was for nothing.

I pray God gives me at least the time on Earth to realize the direction of my care and see its length.

Amen.
