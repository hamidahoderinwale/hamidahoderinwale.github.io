    <h2>Spending Time</h2>

    <p>How we spend our days is how we’ll spend our lives. Or so they say.</p>

<p>Today was a good day.</p>

<p>But what we do over the weeks, months, and years makes our legacies.</p>

<p>To the extent that I care about legacy, I’ll try to do the goodness, the kindness, and the care.</p>

<p>For the privileged, for myself, it seems like our lives are built such that we might not be tasked with finding meaning but with choosing what to care about.</p>

<p>I worry that this thought, the act of it, overwhelms…</p>

<p>So much that a freak event takes your life away, and all this thought is for nothing, was for nothing.</p>

<p>I pray God gives me at least the time on Earth to realize the direction of my care and see its length.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>
